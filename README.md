## Overview 
This is my modified copy of the https-c2-done-right.sh script, to work with certbot properly on Ubuntu
## OS Support
Currently the script has been tested on:
- Ubuntu 18.04
- Ubuntu 20.04
## Usage
Run the script, it is pretty communicative with what it needs

## Todo:
- add options to run individual functions instead of whole script
- add config file
- add cert renewal for long-running c2
- add profile generation
- fix all those pesky single quotes
- learn bash
